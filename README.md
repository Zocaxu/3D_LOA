# Source code for my project 'Creating character Poses based on Lines of Action'

This project was produced as a final project for the course INF585-Computer Animation thaught by Damien ROHMER at Ecole Polytechnique in M1.
This project is inspired by the paper "The Line of Action: an Intuitive Interface for Expressive Character Posing" published by Martin Guay, Marie-Paule Cani and Remi Ronfard presenting an interface to match 3D character poses to LOAs.
This repository comes with a project report, and a proof of concept video that can be found on YouTube at https://youtu.be/mvOJAOtD4Ds
